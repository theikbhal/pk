                    <h2>The Business</h2>
                    <p>Tini Lux is the first line of fashion earrings made specifically for people with metal allergies and sensitive ears. The business targets women between the ages of 18 and 45 who were previously unable to wear earrings due to sensitive skin or allergies.
